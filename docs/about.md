# ABOUT Simple AF: Creality K Series Alternative Firmware
The Simple AF Firmware is an alternative firmware designed to allow full control of your K-series printer using "Vanilla", also known as 'official" Klipper with alternative ABL probes. Simple AF replaces the Creality G-Code and interface meaning you can no longer use the Creality Slicer and Creality Cloud natively. You can still use the Creality Slicer by exporting the code and then uploading it from the Fluidd interface through a web browser or using a USB key (thumb drive). With Creality Cloud, download your files and import them into Creality Slicer (or slicer of your choice) and then export them to a USB Key.  If you use OrcaSlicer you can upload remotely to a network-connected printer, either wireless or directly connected by Cat-5 cable. Other slicers may do things differently, refer to their documentation for directions.

The Simple AF firmware will only work on the K1 series of Creality printers and you must have one of the probes listed to work. You will get errors if you try to install it alone.
