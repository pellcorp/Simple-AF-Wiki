# Simple AF: Creality K1 Series Alternative Firmware

Pell is from Australia, he codes, he chases rabbits and hates haunted printers.

## Special Thanks

We give very special thanks to Richard from [Cartographer3d]<https://cartographer3d.com> and Zarboz from [Watts Kraken]<https://wattskraken.xyz/> for donating Cartographers to the Simple AF project and to [RavenTech3d]<https://raven3dtech.com.au/> and [Beacon3d]<https://beacon3d.com> for donating Beacon probes to the Simple AF project and to continue providing support for the Beacon Probe.

Their continued support enables us to continue to provide you with a quality product.


## Support the Developers

If you are looking for a way to support this project, I have started a fundraiser to purchase a Creality K1 Max 3D printer. The purchase of this and other 3D printers will further my ability to test and release fixes and features for the K1 Series, specifically the K1 and K1 Max.
