# About PellCorp and the Simple AF Project

## Jason Pell aka pellcorp

On discord pellcorp is from Australia, he codes, he chases rabbits, and hates haunted printers.
In real life Jason Pell is a 51 year-old software engineer obssessed with 3D printing. Simple AF firmware is his brainchild born out of a desire to make his Creality K1 be as easy to configure as his Creality Ender 3. Starting as a simple script to recreate his preferred configuration, which at the time, was using a BLTouch for auto-bedleveling. With his never ending obsession for all things 3D Printing he experimented with a Biqu Microprobe, finding it easy to support both. When a request for a free Beacon was surprisingly granted, support for it too was added, then the Cartographer3D Probe V3, BTT Eddy and finally the Voron Klicky.

Crowd funding through Gofundme and Kofi has enabled Jason, fondly referred to as Pell, to purchase equipment such as the Creality K1 Max to add to his Creality K1 and Ender 3 to help provide the commmunity support in freeing them the Creality's butchered firmware.

Zerodotcmd, known as Zero on discord, is a Youtube influencer and Simple AF Discord master dedicated to 3D printing, technology, and software. His channel offers tutorials, product reviews, and comprehensive guides on printer modifications, providing content to help viewers enhance their 3D printing setups and deepen their knowledge of the tools and technologies involved. To quote Zero, "Im just a guy doing stuff."

## Community Contributors
