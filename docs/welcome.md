## The Simple AF User's Guide

Welcome to the Simple AF User's Guide. Our goal is to help you unlock the full potential of your Creality K1 series printer by addressing one of its key limitations—Creality's proprietary firmware. By replacing this with Simple AF firmware, you gain the ability to fine-tune your configuration files through the official Klipper platform and utilize third-party probes, enhancing bed-mesh accuracy for an improved printing experience.

Currently, Simple AF officially supports six probes: the Cartographer3D Probe V3, the Beacon, the BTT Eddy, the BLTouch, the Biqu Microprobe, and the Voron-style Klicky. It is also compatible with both the linear rail gantry mod and the stock gantry.

While the Simple AF development team has made every effort to ensure this guide is comprehensive, it is a work in progress, and some errors may occur. Should you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out via the [Simple AF Discord channel](https://discord.gg/tGGVn5qjgv).
