# Benefits of the Eddy Current Probe

Eddy Current Probes are useful tools for hobbyist 3D printers, providing a nondestructive way to detect surface defects and measure material properties. By using electromagnetic induction, the probe can identify irregularities like cracks or inconsistencies in the printed layers, helping hobbyists maintain the quality of their prints. This is especially beneficial for enthusiasts printing with metal filaments or attempting more intricate, high-precision designs, where part reliability is key. The probe ensures that parts are free of hidden defects before they are used, reducing the likelihood of print failures or the need for costly reprints.

Additionally, Eddy Current Probes can help hobbyists assess the material properties of their prints, such as conductivity and hardness, ensuring they match the desired specifications. This is particularly helpful for those experimenting with different filaments or exploring new printing techniques. By offering real-time feedback, the probe allows enthusiasts to make quick adjustments to their printing process, improving the overall consistency and quality of their prints. Ultimately, Eddy Current Probes enhance the hobbyist 3D printing experience by allowing for greater precision, reducing waste, and ensuring that prints meet personal or project-based requirements.

## Choosing your Probe

If you haven't already chosen your probe here is a brief summary of each.

### [Cartographer3d Probe V3]{/cart/preparation.md#prepare-id}

The Cartographer3D Probe V3 is an advanced eddy current displacement sensor designed to enhance 3D printing accuracy by precisely scanning the printer's bed surface. Compatible with both USB and CAN setups, it offers flexibility in connectivity options. The probe features an integrated ADXL345 accelerometer, enabling input shaping for improved print quality. Its high-speed scanning capability reduces setup time, allowing enthusiasts to achieve optimal bed leveling efficiently. The compact and lightweight design ensures easy installation without adding significant weight to the printer's toolhead. Users can purchase the Cartographer3D Probe V3 directly from the official website at [Cartographer3d](<http://cartographer3d.com>) or through authorized resellers listed on their resellers page.

### The Beacon

The Beacon3D Beacon is an innovative eddy current sensor designed to enhance 3D printing precision by rapidly scanning print bed surfaces with sub-micron accuracy. By mounting the lightweight 3.5g sensor to the printer's toolhead, users can achieve a detailed bed mesh in under 20 seconds, compensating for surface irregularities and ensuring optimal first-layer adhesion. Operating at up to 500mm/s with a 1kHz bandwidth, the Beacon eliminates the need for Z-axis movement during scanning, streamlining the bed leveling process. This efficiency not only reduces setup time but also minimizes print failures caused by bed imperfections. The Beacon is compatible with Klipper firmware and requires a metal surface or substrate for operation. Interested users can purchase the Beacon directly from the official website at <https://beacon3d.com>.

### BTT Eddy

The BIGTREETECH (BTT) Eddy is an advanced auto bed leveling sensor that utilizes eddy current technology to deliver rapid and precise bed leveling for 3D printers. Weighing only 6 grams, it minimizes impact on the printer's movement while providing 0.0005mm precision leveling. The sensor heats up in just 20 seconds, ensuring minimal downtime before printing. Its thermal compensation feature maintains accuracy across varying temperatures, and the Z-axis return function ensures consistent print quality. Compatible with a wide range of 3D printers, including models like the Ender 3, the BTT Eddy enhances the printing experience by reducing setup time and improving first-layer adhesion, leading to more successful prints. Enthusiasts can purchase the BTT Eddy from various retailers, including Amazon AMAZON.COM and Aliexpress.com.
