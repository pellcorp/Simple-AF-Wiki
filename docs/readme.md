## Support the Developers

If you are looking for a way to support this project, I have started a fundraiser to purchase a Creality K1 Max 3D printer. The purchase of this and other 3D printers will further my ability to test and release fixes and features for the K1 Series, specifically the K1 and K1 Max.
