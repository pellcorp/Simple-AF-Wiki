## Installation & Update
<hr>

- Follow this <a href="../reset-factory-settings">Reset Factory Settings</a> section to restore default settings before Install/Update.

- When it's done, insert USB drive in your computer.

- You need to format it in FAT32 with 4096 allocation size (or exFAT on some USB drives).

- Copy `.img` firmware file to the root of your USB drive and remove it from your computer.

- Turn on the printer.

- When you are on home screen, plug USB drive on the front of the printer.

- A popup should appear indicating a new available update.

- Press `Upgrade` and wait during the update process.

- When it's done, the printer restarts.

- Once you are on the home screen, you can remove the USB drive.

- Perfom a new Self Check on the new firmware by going to `Settings` ‚Üí `Self-check`.

    !!! Warning
        **After a factory reset, all features already been installed with <a href="../../helper-script/helper-script-installation">Creality Helper Script</a>  must be reinstalled.**


## Skip the Startup Self-Check
<hr>

This can be useful if you have made modifications to the printer (BLTouch etc...) and you can no longer perform the Startup Self Check.

- Download and unzip this file: :material-download: [debugmode_JumpSelftest.zip](https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/raw/main/downloads/Files/debugmode_JumpSelftest.zip)

- Insert USB drive in your computer.

- Copy the `debugmode_JumpSelftest` file to the root of your USB drive and remove it from your computer.

- Plug USB drive on the front of the printer and turn it on.

- At startup, Self-Check will be skipped.

- If you leave the USB drive inserted the Startup Self-Check will still be ignored even after reboot.

- If you no longer want to have the USB drive inserted (until the next factory reset), connect to SSH (Guide is available <a href="../ssh-connection">here</a>) and enter this command:

    ```
    sed -i 's/"self_test_sw":1/"self_test_sw":0/' /usr/data/creality/userdata/config/system_config.json
    ```


## Enable Root Access
<hr>

!!! Note
    **Root access must be re-enabled if you restore the printer to factory settings.**

- On the screen UI, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Root account information`:

    <img width="600" src="../../assets/img/Install-Rooted-Firmware/01.png">

- Carefully review the disclaimer, check the agreement box, wait 30 seconds and click on `OK` button:

    <img width="600" src="../../assets/img/Install-Rooted-Firmware/02.png">

- Root access is now enabled, you can click on `OK` button:

    <img width="600" src="../../assets/img/Install-Rooted-Firmware/04.png">

- You can now connect to SSH (Guide is available <a href="../ssh-connection">here</a>) with:
  
    * User: `root`
    * Password: `creality_ender3v3`
