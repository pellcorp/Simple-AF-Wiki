# Simple AF: Creality K Series Alternative Firmware Wiki

The Simple AF Firmware is an alternative firmware designed to allow you to control your K-series printer using "Vanilla" Klipper with alternative ABL probes.
Simple AF replaces the Creality G-Code and interface meaning you can no longer use the Creality Slicer and Creality Cloud natively.

<b>  WE CAN NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO YOUR PRINTER - INSTALLING CUSTOM FIRMWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK!</b>

## Supported Probes
The advantage of using firmware like Simple AF is that you have full control over your printer configurations, making it easier to install any of the supported probes listed:
<uL>
  <li>Cartographer</li>
  <li>Beacon (coming soon)</li>
  <li>BTT Eddy</li>
  <li>Microprobe</li>
  <li>CRTouch, BLTouch, 3DTouch</li>
</uL>

## Supported Printers
Currently, Simple AF only works on the following K-series printers:
<ul>
  <li>K1</li>
  <li>K1 Max</li>
  <li>K1 C</li>
  <li>K1 SE (coming soon)</li>
  <li>K1 Max SE (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

## Support the Developers

If you are looking for a way to support this project, I have started a fundraiser to purchase a Creality K1 Max 3D printer. The purchase of this and other 3d printers furthers my ability to test and release fixes and features for the K1-series, specifically the K1 and K1 Max.
