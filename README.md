# Simple AF: Creality K Series Alternative Firmware Wiki

This Guide is designed to help you install the Simple AF firmware as an alternative to the Creality Firmware for the K1 Series Printers.
This allows you to use 3d-party hardware specifically, ABL probes (Automatic Bed Leveling probes) such as the Cartographer3D or the Biqu Microprobe as examples by replacing the Creality G-Code and their Klipper versing with the "vanilla" version of Klipper.

You must have one of the supported probes below to install and use the Simple AF firmware.
<uL>
  <li>Cartographer</li>
  <li>Beacon (coming soon)</li>
  <li>BTT Eddy</li>
  <li>Microprobe</li>
  <li>CRTouch, BLTouch, 3DTouch</li>
</uL>

Currently, Simple AF only works on the following K-series printers:

  <li>K1 Max</li>
  <li>K1 C</li>
