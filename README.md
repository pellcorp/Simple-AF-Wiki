# Simple AF: Creality K Series Alternative Firmware Wiki

This Guide is designed to help you install the Simple AF firmware as an alternative to the Creality Firmware for the K1 Series Printers.
This allows you to use 3d-party hardware specifically, ABL probes (Automatic Bed Leveling probes) such as the Cartographer3D or the Biqu Microprobe (as examples) by replacing the Creality G-Code and their version of Klipper with the "vanilla" or official version of Klipper.

## Support the Developers

If you are looking for a way to support this project, I have started a fundraiser to purchase a Creality K1 Max 3D printer. The purchase of this and other 3d printers furthers my ability to test and release fixes and features for the K1-series, specifically the K1 and K1 Max.
